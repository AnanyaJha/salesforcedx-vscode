<p>Yes, you can use your normal support channels to receive support from Salesforce. We also accept bugs and feature requests through the <a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/issues">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>However, Salesforce does not provide support for Visual Studio Code itself. This product is created by Microsoft. You can learn more about Visual Studio Code through <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs">their documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-a-real-salesforce-project-im-worried-because-its-open-source">Is this a real Salesforce project? I‚Äôm worried because it‚Äôs open source.</h2>

<p>Yes, this is an official and supported Salesforce project. We have dedicated product and engineering resources for this tool just as we do with any other project. We make the extensions open source because <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2018/12/the-future-of-salesforce-ides.html">we believe the best developer tools are built in the open</a>.</p>
